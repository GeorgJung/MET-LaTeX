It should be stored in a central place where LaTeX can find it or inside a directory that contains the other LaTeX sources for a specific course. The individual LaTeX-files for your assessments can be in subdirectories of the one containing `config.tex` (up to two levels).\r\n* Write your assessments, with `newcsen` as document style and the respective options (see below).\r\n\r\n### Documantation\r\n\r\n**Files**\r\n\r\n* `newcsen.cls` - New class file to compile course documents.\r\n* `config.tex` - Example configuration file to test the class.\r\n* `PracticeAssignment01.tex` - Example assessment file to test the class.\r\n* `GUC-logo.pdf` - PDF vectorized version of the GUC logo (gets loaded with option \"logo\" unless other file is specified).\r\n* `GUC-logo-stripped.pdf` - Another version of the GUC logo, can be specified individually.\r\n* `FExtinguish.pdf` - Another logo to test the scaling. Use your own course logo, if you like.\r\n\r\n**Implemented so far:**\r\n- Automatic result table\r\n- Automatic search for global config file in current and parent and parent of parent directory\r\n- Automatic setting of image search path according to location of config file\r\n- options: see below.\r\n- commands: `\\Institute{}` `\\Department{}` `\\Class{}` `\\Title{}` `\\Lecturer[]{}` `\\Email{}` `\\Logo{}` `\\Topic{}` `\\Date{}` and many more...\r\n- exercise environment\r\n- bonus-exercise environment\r\n- options practice (default) and assignment usable now\r\n- scratch paper generator\r\n- cover pages\r\n- spacing\r\n\r\n_To do_:\r\n- testing\r\n- cleanup (consistently prefix variable names and booleans, tighten code)\r\n- Redo formula sheet (and maybe solutions) by using the environ package with `\\detokenize{\\BODY}` (possible loss of backward compatibility!)\r\n  (check [http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/67550/write-content-of-box-to-a-file](StackExchange))\r\n- nicer subproblem handling\r\n- provide `scratchpaper` command to put scratch paper at other place than last pages\r\n\r\n**Document class options:**\r\n\r\n_General_\r\n* `solution` - show solution\r\n\r\n_Type_\r\n* `practice` - compile a practice assignment\r\n* `assignment` - compile an assignment\r\n* `popquiz` - compile a popquiz\r\n* `quiz` - compile a quiz\r\n* `mock` - compile a mock exam\r\n* `midterm` - compile the midterm exam\r\n* `final` - compile the final exam\r\n* `makeup` - compile the makeup exam\r\n\r\n_Logo?_\r\n* `logo` - add a logo to the output\r\n\r\n_Formula sheets_\r\n* `formula` - add a formula sheet at the end of the assessment (necessary if formulas are referenced!)\r\n\r\n_Details_\r\n* `nomarktbl` - suppress marking table on first page (for marked assessments)\r\n* `noid` - suppress student identification form (e.g., for computerized assessments)\r\n* `nobarcode` - suppress barcode placeholder (e.g., for computerized assessments)\r\n* `idform` - print student id-form on cover page instead of barcode\r\n* `nonumber` - suppress numbering\r\n* `coverpage` - generate a cover page (default for quiz, mock exam, midterm, final, and makeup)\r\n* `nocover` - do not generate a cover page (default for practice assignment, assignment, popquiz)\r\n* `noinstruct` - suppress instructions on cover page\r\n\r\n**Commands for config.tex**\r\n\r\n* `\\Institute{}` -

adds content of braces to front/cover-page to include extra administrative information (_e.g._, for distinguishing majors or type of the exam such as final, mid-final, or second makeup)\r\n* `\\AddFormula[]{}` - adds a formula for the formula sheet (optional title, should be set with the current version due to a bug)\r\n* `\\SolutionSpace{}` - sets a space to be left for the solution if the solution is not shown\r\n* `\\Mark{}` -

Use `\\item` for the individual answers, use `\\checkedItem` for individual answers that should appear check-marked in the solution.\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n\r\nI am experienced with using LaTeX, but I am not experienced with style authoring. Some commands should be environments and vice versa, various improvements can be made. However, the style has proven very useful to me. Use (and improve) as you see fit.","tagline":"LaTeX Style for exams, assignments, quizzes, etc., at the faculty for Media Engineering and Technology (MET) at the German University in Cairo (GUC)","google":""}
